# /**
#  * An image quantizer that improves on the quality of a standard K-Means
#  * algorithm by setting the K-Means initial state to the output of a Wu
#  * quantizer, instead of random centroids. Improves on speed by several
#  * optimizations, as implemented in Wsmeans, or Weighted Square Means, K-Means
#  * with those optimizations.
#  *
#  * This algorithm was designed by M. Emre Celebi, and was found in their 2011
#  * paper, Improving the Performance of K-Means for Color Quantization.
